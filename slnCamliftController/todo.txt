Version 2.0.4:
Andy:
* if directory does not exist when take picture, set to default and pop dialog telling the user
* step settings size label is overlapping the text box
* change "distance" to "step sizes". add the "step sizes" 
* change auto size to true in auto run settings radio buttons
* add "presets" from main controls to auto run step sizes
  - make sure slice overlap works for this option
* change order in auto run to 1. calculate 2. presets 3. manual
* handle if live view is open and they click auto run
* if you take a picture with live view open and zoomed in, live view doesn't restore zoom
* the dialog for closing the form should say "Move camera back to top?" instead of "motor."
* default live view size to 1048x746
* in auto run window, add a "here" button to start and stop position
Josh:
* when they pop a window, make it start next to frmControls
* 20x stepsize label doesn't work
* savable step size profiles
Unassigned:
* fix motor bump bug - supercedes limit switch (critical)
* always take landscape (critical)
* get 5D working (critical)

Version 2.1.0:

Their Ideas:
Further Discussion Needed:
* Cosmetics
* Add Manage Memory Registers button on Main Window
* Investigate inconsistent coloring

Our Ideas:
* lazy motor - don't try to initialize until motor is needed
    - instead of a message box for silverpak, show frmcontrols and disable everything except a button labeled "Initialize Motor" 
* park distance. - Never really go to 0 except for initialization.  
    - the perceived "0" is really parkDistance, this prevents switch-sitting hardware bugs. 
    - don't let attempts to step past 0 go through. translate into absolute motion. 
* right click step sizes to bring up edit dialog 
* auto run -> unplug camera during run -> exit -> assertion failed 
* get rid of that warning message about the silverpak dispose thing 
* make zoom rectangle more accurate in live view
* make scrolling in zoomed in mode smoother
* virtual limit switch?
* savable step size settings
