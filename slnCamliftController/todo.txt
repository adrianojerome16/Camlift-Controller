
Version 2.0.2:

Version 2.1.0:

Their Ideas:
* Cosmetics
* Add Manage Memory Registers button on Main Window
* Shitf + resize = aspect ratio
* Show Autorun Window next to Main Window always.
* Make Autorun non-dialog
* Savable StepSizes profiles
* Investigate inconsistent coloring

Our Ideas:
* lazy motor - don't try to initialize until motor is needed 
    - instead of a message box for silverpak, show frmcontrols and disable everything except a button labeled "Initialize Motor" 
* park distance. - Never really go to 0 except for initialization.  
    - the perceived "0" is really parkDistance, this prevents switch-sitting hardware bugs. 
    - don't let attempts to step past 0 go through. translate into absolute motion. 
* right click step sizes to bring up edit dialog 
* auto run -> unplug camera during run -> exit -> assertion failed 
* get rid of that warning message about the silverpak dispose thing
