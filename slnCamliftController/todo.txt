Version 2.1.1:
Josh:
* absolute coordinates so that motor is never inaccurate
Andy:
* re-order the presets in auto run
* presets is not integrated into auto run profiles

Version 3.0.0:
* only attach live view to frmcontrols by default; otherwise remember in settings

Other Ideas:
* Add Manage Memory Registers button on Main Window
* Investigate inconsistent coloring
* instead of a message box for silverpak, show frmcontrols and disable everything except a button labeled "Initialize Motor" 
* don't let attempts to step past 0 go through. translate into absolute motion. 
* right click step sizes to bring up edit dialog 
* make zoom rectangle more accurate in live view
* make scrolling in zoomed in mode smoother
* auto run -> unplug camera during run -> exit -> assertion failed 
* get rid of that warning message about the silverpak dispose thing
