Version 2.0
* "comm port in use" - "It appears another program is using the camera. Please
  close EOS Utility or any other application that is using the camera."
* "liveview failed exception" - "Live View is disabled in the camera. Please use
  EOS Utility to enable Live View."
* reduce timeout to 10 seconds
* don't crash when an exception is thrown in non gui thread

Version 3.0
* lazy motor - don't try to initialize until motor is needed
	- instead of a message box for silverpak, show frmcontrols and disable everything except a button labeled "Initialize Motor"
* park distance. - Never really go to 0 except for initialization. 
	- the perceived "0" is really parkDistance, this prevents switch-sitting hardware bugs.
	- don't let attempts to step past 0 go through. translate into absolute motion.
* right click step sizes to bring up edit dialog
* auto run -> unplug camera during run -> exit -> assertion failed
* get rid of that warning message about the silverpak dispose thing
