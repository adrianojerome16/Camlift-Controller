* main window
	- Have "Set Autorun Start/Stop" (probably with fewer words) buttons near "Autorun..." button so that the user doesn't need to go through the "Store" menu.
* live view:
	- grid overlayed on view similar to canon's
	- WhiteBalance settings similar to Canon's.
	- Draggable white box in the view area for determining the WhiteBalance and zoom location.
	- "Actual Size"/zoom button similar to Canon's.
* auto run
	- Add an "Adjust overlap" setting where the user can adjust the percentage of overlap between slices.
		Default 10%
		 min 0%
		 max ?%.
		 The user might see "0%" when it's really 10% and "-10%" when it's really 0%.
	- Have radio buttons instead of combo boxes for Objective, Mag, and Iris
* make sure disconnects are handled for camera class and silverpak class
* settings -> edit step settings is broken
* settigs -> advanced, OK button doesn't close dialog
* help-> user's guide, broken link
* why can't you frmControls.show() instead of frmControls.showDialog() ?
