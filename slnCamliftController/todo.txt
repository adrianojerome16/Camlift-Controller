Version 2.0.4:
* live view same size as eos
* zoom
	- match eos
	- fit -> 100 -> 200
* autorun - start/stop need save buttons
* move right after fire (download during dwell)
* changing the last step setting doesn't work
* instead of memX, posX
* do you want to move the motor back to zero? yes no cancel
Josh:
* Add a 20X Objective to objectives.xml
* Investigate Autorun not stepping finer than 12.

Version 2.1.0:

Their Ideas:
Further Discussion Needed:
* Cosmetics
* Add Manage Memory Registers button on Main Window
* Investigate inconsistent coloring

$100
* Show Autorun Window non-dialog and next to Main Window always.

$300
* Savable StepSizes profiles

$300
* When the picture is rotated in live view, save the takepicture as rotated

Feasible?
* Shitf + resize = aspect ratio


Our Ideas:
* lazy motor - don't try to initialize until motor is needed
    - instead of a message box for silverpak, show frmcontrols and disable everything except a button labeled "Initialize Motor" 
* park distance. - Never really go to 0 except for initialization.  
    - the perceived "0" is really parkDistance, this prevents switch-sitting hardware bugs. 
    - don't let attempts to step past 0 go through. translate into absolute motion. 
* right click step sizes to bring up edit dialog 
* auto run -> unplug camera during run -> exit -> assertion failed 
* get rid of that warning message about the silverpak dispose thing 
* make zoom rectangle more accurate in live view
* make scrolling in zoomed in mode smoother
