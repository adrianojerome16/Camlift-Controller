* auto run
	- Add an "Adjust overlap" setting where the user can adjust the percentage of overlap between slices.
		Default 10%
		 min 0%
		 max ?%
		 The user might see "0%" when it's really 10% and "-10%" when it's really 0%.
	- Load:
		- Saved Positions
	- Save setup (fancier)
	- Fix calculation discrepencies
* auto run -> unplug camera during run -> exit -> assertion failed


Version 3.0
* lazy motor - don't try to initialize until motor is needed
	- instead of a message box for silverpak, show frmcontrols and disable everything except a button labeled "Initialize Motor"
* park distance. Never really go to 0 except for initialization. the perceived "0" is really parkDistance, this prevents switch-sitting hardware bugs.
* right click step sizes to bring up edit dialog
