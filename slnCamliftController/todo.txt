
Put motor.xml and settings index.xml into the installer so that uninstall is clean

Version 3.0.0:
* only attach live view to frmcontrols by default; otherwise remember in settings
* save preset data with auto run. this involves saving step size settings with it

Other Ideas:
* Add Manage Memory Registers button on Main Window
* Investigate inconsistent coloring
* instead of a message box for silverpak, show frmcontrols and disable everything except a button labeled "Initialize Motor" 
* don't let attempts to step past 0 go through. translate into absolute motion. 
* right click step sizes to bring up edit dialog 
* make zoom rectangle more accurate in live view
* make scrolling in zoomed in mode smoother
* auto run -> unplug camera during run -> exit -> assertion failed
