Version 2.1.1:
* landscape exif tag or whatever

Other Ideas:
* Add Manage Memory Registers button on Main Window
* Investigate inconsistent coloring
* instead of a message box for silverpak, show frmcontrols and disable everything except a button labeled "Initialize Motor" 
* don't let attempts to step past 0 go through. translate into absolute motion. 
* right click step sizes to bring up edit dialog 
* make zoom rectangle more accurate in live view
* make scrolling in zoomed in mode smoother
* auto run -> unplug camera during run -> exit -> assertion failed 
* get rid of that warning message about the silverpak dispose thing
