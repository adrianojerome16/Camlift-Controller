--NOTES--

Autorun Dialog:

Add an "Adjust overlap" setting where the user can adjust the percentage of overlap between slices. 
 Default 10%
 min 0%
 max ?%.
 The user might see "0%" when it's really 10% and "-10%" when it's really 0%.

Have radio buttons instead of combo boxes for Objective, Mag, and Iris.


Main Window:

Have "Set Autorun Start/Stop" (probably with fewer words) buttons near "Autorun..." button so that the user doesn't need to go through the "Store" menu.

Have a "Live View" button or menu item that opens the Live View Window. 

Needs a way to specify where the camera is storing the images it takes ("My Pictures" etc.).


Live View Window:

Area with the live view in it (obviously). 

WhiteBalance settings similar to Canon's.

Dragable white box in the view area for determining the WhiteBalance and zoom location.

"Grid" button similar to Canon's.

"Actual Size"/zoom button similar to Canon's.
