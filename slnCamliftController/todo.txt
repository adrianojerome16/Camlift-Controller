Their Ideas:
Further Discussion Needed:
* Cosmetics
* Add Manage Memory Registers button on Main Window
* Investigate inconsistent coloring

$100
* Show Autorun Window non-dialog and next to Main Window always.

$300
* Savable StepSizes profiles

Feasible?
* Shitf + resize = aspect ratio


Our Ideas:
* lazy motor - don't try to initialize until motor is needed
    - instead of a message box for silverpak, show frmcontrols and disable everything except a button labeled "Initialize Motor" 
* park distance. - Never really go to 0 except for initialization.  
    - the perceived "0" is really parkDistance, this prevents switch-sitting hardware bugs. 
    - don't let attempts to step past 0 go through. translate into absolute motion. 
* right click step sizes to bring up edit dialog 
* auto run -> unplug camera during run -> exit -> assertion failed 
* get rid of that warning message about the silverpak dispose thing
